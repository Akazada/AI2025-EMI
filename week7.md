### Final Lab Questions:
1. How do specific prompt keywords affect the image output?
*Descriptive words like “bright” or “dark” change the mood of the image.

*Style words like “cartoon” or “realistic” tell the AI how to style the image.

*Subject words like “mountain” or “dog” focus on what’s in the image.

*Composition words like “close-up” or “wide shot” set the view of the image.

3. What image details are hardest to replicate? Why?
*Tiny details like skin texture or fabric are tricky for the AI to recreate perfectly.

*Facial expressions are hard because they need to capture emotion and subtle changes.

*Natural elements like water or clouds are tough because they constantly change.

*Abstract ideas like "feeling peaceful" don’t easily turn into visual images.

5. How can prompts be refined to get closer to a target visual? Provide a revised prompt and explain your reasoning.
6. 
*To get a closer result, make your prompt more detailed. Instead of saying something like “A landscape with mountains,” you can say:
Refined Prompt: “A peaceful landscape at sunset with misty mountains in the background, a calm river reflecting orange and purple skies, and a few trees along the riverbank.”

*This gives clear details about lighting, mood, colors, and composition, helping the AI create the image more accurately.
